<!-- Note: Start the server first 


#Steps to start the server

1. cd *****/server (Enter into the server workspace)
2. run the command - npx json-server db.json


#Steps to start the app

0. cd ****/todo (Enter into the todo app workspace)
    (By default node_modules are ignored by git)
1. run - npm i (or) npm i -f
2. run the command - npm start

(if facing any issue running the application)
1. delete the folder-> node_modules 
2. run npm i (which adds all the libraries )
3. run the command - npm start



Why json-server? 
json-server is a very light weight tool when working with standalone single page application.
