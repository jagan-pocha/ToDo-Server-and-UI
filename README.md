### Objective

To build out this full-stack todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


**Client Side**

users should be able to:

-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

**Server Side**

-   Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side
-   Implement routes for all listed **CRUD** operations
-   No authentication / session management is required. Imagine you're building this application for a single user (yourself)
